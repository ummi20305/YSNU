            Goal 2: Zero Hunger by 2030
            Achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 is a critical objective outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
            However, the global issue of hunger and food insecurity has witnessed a troubling surge since 2015, 
            exacerbated by a convergence of factors including the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing wars and recent conflicts,  effects 
            of climate change, and widening gaps between income inqualities.
        </pre>
        <pre>
            Our website aims to help get closer to the target by allowing for the increase in access to information specifically about
            poverty and also direct ways to help and donate individuals through our shop. Further information is availble on our contents pages
            specifically more on statistics of world hunger and current progress. Along with this we have a feedback form for you to be able to
            directly give us feedback on ways we can also improve our website.
